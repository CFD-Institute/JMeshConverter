# MisaCFDJava
At this early stage, this code is a Java version of [GmshToVtkAndTecplotCpp11](https://github.com/truongd8593/GmshToVtkAndTecplotCpp11).
I will add CFD solvers to this repo later on.

#Why is it named as MisaCFD?

* CFD stands for computational fluid dynamics.

* Misa is my nickname when I play CS Source with my colleagues at Axon Active :)

#Features

* Meshing aspects: the code takes an unstructured quadrilateral mesh generated by GMSH and convert it to vtk and/or Tecplot data formats.  

* CFD aspects: conventional finite volume solver.

* Design patterns: my Java implementation makes use of some design patterns eg. singleton, builder patterns.
