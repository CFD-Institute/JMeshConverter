# CFDJava
At this early stage, this code is a Java version of [GmshToVtkAndTecplotCpp11](https://github.com/truongd8593/GmshToVtkAndTecplotCpp11).
I will add CFD solvers to this repo later on.

# Features

* Meshing aspects: the code takes an unstructured quadrilateral mesh generated by GMSH and convert it to vtk and/or Tecplot data formats.  

* CFD aspects: conventional finite volume solver.

* Design patterns: my Java implementation makes use of some design patterns eg. singleton, builder patterns.

# To do

* Mesh converter for [delaundo](https://www.swmath.org/software/9675).
